        <p>Oh hi, didn't see you there! I'm Chaney and this is a test website used for my AP Computer Science Principles Class. It's <b> GREAT!</b></p>
        
        <p>I started off with learning <strong>HTML</strong> and <span id="css">CSS</span>. I did this on Code.ORG which kept getting blocked on the school's wifi network. Classy Pentucket technology.</p>

            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>This is the part in the sample website where CodeHS promotes their own service from within the service. So...we're gonna skip that. Instead, I'm going to talk about the Cafe Jazz</p>
        <a href="https://codehs.com/editor/sandbox"><img class="profilePic" src="https://cdn.chaneygoldstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cafe-Jazz-Dec-2022-1-930x620.png"></a>
        <h2>What Is It?</h2>
        <p>Cafe Jazz is an event held twice a year in the "Dining Commons" which consists of the school's Big Band and Award-winning jazz combo performing jazz standards recognized throughout the industry.</p>
        <p>It's pretty cool if you ask me as it shows what we're all capable of as musicians in a way that really showcases our individual talents due to Jazz being "open".</p>
        <h2>Should You Go?</h2>
        <p>If you're not a fan of jazz, then I can't say that Cafe Jazz is for you. But it's still a cool event nonetheless. The tech aspect is always interesting with cool lighting and a recording setup that I end up making way too complicated. Here's a video below</p>

        <h2>Now here's something <b>interesting...</b></h2><p>CodeHS created a subdomain for me automatically, which is fine. But I ended up wanting to go a bit more custom. So, I uploaded the HTML file to my web server in Arizona!
        </p>
        
        <p>Like the CodeHS site, this is a publicly visible URL, so you can easily share your homepage with friends and family by sending them a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">link</a>! Though, you probably don't need that Wikipedia article since you know what that is.</p>
        
        <h2>Why I Created This</h2>
        
        <p>Even though I am doing this as an assignment for my AP Computer Science Principles class, I've always built websites on pre-made frameworks (e.g. Weebly, Wix, WordPress)
        <br>I've always wanted to properly learn how to code sites from scratch and I like that I'm beginning to dip my toes in the world of HTML and CSS as I know that these standard <b><i>formats</i></b> will be useful.
        </p>

<h2>That's all folks!</h2>
